    <h1> Bad Liar </h1>
    <h2> Selena Gomez </h2>
      <p> I was walking down the street the other day<br/>
          Tryna distract myself<br/>
          But then I see your face<br/>
          Oh wait, that's someone else<br/>
          Tryna play it coy<br/>
          Tryna make it disappear<br/>
          But just like the battle of Troy<br/>
          There's nothing subtle here<br/>
          In my room there's a king size space<br/>
          Bigger than it used to be<br/>
          If you want you can rent that place<br/>
          Call me an amenity<br/>
          Even if it's in my dreams</p>
      <p> Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind<br/>
          Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine </p>
      <p> Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Not to think about you<br/>
          No, no, no, no<br/>
          Not to think about you<br/>
          No, no, no, no<br/>
          Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Not to give in to you<br/>
          No, no, no, no<br/>
          Not to give in to you<br/>
          No, no, no, no </p>
      <p> With my feelings on fire<br/>
          Guess I'm a bad liar </p>
      <p> I see how your attention builds<br/>
          It's like looking in a mirror<br/>
          Your touch like a happy pill<br/>
          But still all we do is fear<br/>
          What could possibly happen next?<br/>
          Can we focus on the love?<br/>
          Paint my kiss across your chest<br/>
          If you're the art, I'll be the brush </p>
      <p> Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind<br/>
          Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine</p>
      <p> Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Not to think about you<br/>
          No, no, no, no<br/>
          Not to think about you<br/>
          No, no, no, no<br/>
          Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          I'm tryin', I'm tryin'<br/>
          Not to give in to you<br/>
          No, no, no, no<br/>
          Not to give in to you<br/>
          No, no, no, no</p>
